# Volkswagen ID.3 CAN parameters version 1.0

This file contains all the information for people to be able to extract live data from their VW ID.3 for example thorugh EVNotify, Leafspy, OVMS etc.

And please don't send me question on how I did to find this out, because its part of my own IP and the crazy amount of time i put in it....

NB. The use of this information on your car is strictly your own responsibilty, so don't call me if something is broken. But rest assured, I use this to monitor my own ID.3 so I feel confident enough to use this.
