# Volkswagen MEB EV cars CAN UDS parameters

This file contains all the information for people to be able to extract live data from their VW MEB based cars like ID.3 ID.4, Enyaq etc and implement it in other tools like EVNotify, Leafspy, OVMS etc.

And please don't send me question on how I did to find this out, because its part of my own IP and the crazy amount of time i put in it....

NB. The use of this information on your car is strictly your own responsibilty, so don't hunt med down if something gets broken if you it. But rest assured, I use this to monitor my own ID.3 so I feel confident enough to use this.

Differences between cars:
The only know differences i have found yet is the number of HV battery cells, so the net capacity will decide how many cells there is in the pack.

Tested on the following cars:
VW ID.x cars and Skoda Enyaq
Will probably also work on Seat Cupra Bravo and Audi Q4 e-tron.

Version info:
